# The Analytics Edge

### EDX Course MITx - 15.071x (Summer 2015)

#### Week 1

This week's lectures and assignment were an introduction to R and its basic syntax. The assigmnents revolved around loading datasets in CSV format, and finding correlations in the data using the 'table' and 'tapply' commands. Plots were also introduced, with scatter plots, boxplots, and histograms.

I found myself generating a lot of TRUE/FALSE tables for dataframes, and then answering "what is the proportion of x that are TRUE" by manually dividing the required "TRUE" count by the sum of TRUE and FALSE. I wonder if there's a shorthand for that.
